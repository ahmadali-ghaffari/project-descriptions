## Technologies

In this project we are using Angular as frontend, and Node.js as backend combined with MySQL as database.
Apprentices create routing and layout included Angular components and services which use mock data at this point.
Apprentices create backend endpoints with Express which use a database layer to work with data.
Apprentices wire together frontend and backend and we can see real data in frontend received from backend.
Apprentices write tests for Angular components and services as well as backend endpoints.
