# Computer Vision ðŸ‘€

## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to write an application that can capture video input from an external source, detect and recognize speed limit signs and control the speed of an autonomous car accordingly.

## Technologies

 -  C++
 -  OpenCV
 -  SQLite
 -  Google Test
 -  Python
 
 ## Features
  
First, the apprentices learn the basics of image processing and some popular sorting algorithms. Then they implement object detection (circles, simple shapes and YOLO) and text recognition (Tesseract OCR) algorithms. They use SQL databases for persistent data storage and logging.
