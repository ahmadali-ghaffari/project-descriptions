# Operations

## Description

The Operations team is responsible for providing tools and infrastructure to all the other teams in the project phase, so they can have a standaridzed development environment. The project itself is not necessarily about building something new and unseen before, rather about learning how to use the tools that are in the repertoire of every DevOps engineer. While learning the usage of the tools, the apprentices also understand the concepts behind each technology. This is important because by understanding how and why are these technologies working in the way they are, the switch to a new technology can be almost effortless and really quick.

## Technologies

The toolset that the apprentices use daily consists of:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Terraform
- CI servers (Jenkins/CircleCi)
- Linux Command Line 
- Docker
- ELK stack / Nagios
