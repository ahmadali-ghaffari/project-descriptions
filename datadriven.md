# Data-Driven ðŸ¤–

## Description

Students will learn the basics of Data Science and Data Engineering by learning Python, writing code for data mining, manipulating large datasets and creating their own Machine Learning models from scratch.  
At the end of the course they will be able to create their very own, personalized Movie recommendation system. 

More and more data is generated every day and therefor there is an even bigger need for specialists who can spot the patterns and turn that data into useful information. 
Data related jobs are among the highest paying ones, and with the advancements in Deep Learning, AI technologies are more hyped than ever.

## Technologies

Instead of teaching them about the very latest buzzword driven concepts and technologies, we aim to give the students a solid foundation in the basics of Data Science, so they can be a better asset for the companies in the long run.

- Python 3 and popular libraries used for data manipulation (pandas, NumPy, ScraPy, scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup4)
- Data mining via Social Media REST APIs (JSON/XML) and writing webcrawlers (for HTML content)
- Basic data cleaning and transformation methodologies, feature extraction methods
- Regular Expressions (and basic Natural Language Processing if there is enough time)
- SQL querries
- Simple Machine Learning models (Regression models, kNN, Decision Trees)

Students will also learn about popular, publicly available databases, running Pyhton as a backend (Flask or Django) and some basic data visualization, depending on how quickly they advance.  
Students will learn to implement certain Machine Learning techniques from scratch, instead of simply relying on calling libraries and treating the models as black boxes. 

The first ~4 weeks of the course consists of learning the aforementioned technologies and doing tutorials. 
After that, there is less hand holidng, and students are expected to find solutions on their own via trial and error (especially with modelling). 

The goal of the course is to allow students to:
- Have a basic understanding of what a Data Scientist does, and be able to work under Data Scientists as Data Engineers
- Learn how to be a valuable asset for companies looking for junior Data Scientists / Data Engineers
- Learn how to manipulate and clean large datasets, and how to be assertive when they have an idea for a usecase on the company's available data
- Give them a wide view on different data related subjects and fields, so they will later be able to find further tutorials and specialize in these areas on their own
- If they do not chose to be a Data Scientist / Data Engineer, be able to help their company with their large amounts of data or work as a Full Stack Python developer

At the end of the course the students will implement their very own Movie recommendation system based on the combination of the IMDB, MovieLens and manually crawled datasets. 

## Prerequisits to take the course

Please only take this course if you are already familiar with the following techniques:
- Have strong full stack developer skills (HTML, JS, CSS,  REST APIs: XML and JSON)
- Have learned about either SQL or NoSQL technologies 
- Familiar with Office Excel (or similar spreadsheet software)
- Have a **basic** understanding of statistics, probability, linear algebra (you know what vectors and matrices are) - we will not dwell into the math deeply here, but it will be required later in this field to have a deeper understanding. You can always (re)learn these conmcepts from KhanAcademy!
- Have at least 8GB of RAM and 10GB free disk space. Any OS is fine, because Python runs on pretty much everything. You can chose your own IDE (or Notebook) for Python

We will use Python for almsot every task. If you already know C++ or JAVA it will be much easier for you to find a job, as some Deep Learning and Big Data technologies rely on these programming languages. 

The main difference between this class and the others is that there are will be no user stories, and most of the tasks will be required to be done by everyone, instead together in paralel as a team, to ensure everyone learns the same things. 

Please note that as a Data Scientist / Data Engineer, the amount of possible technologies/models/domain knowledge to learn is **infinite**. 
No one knows everything in this field, so bright people work together to come up with solutions for the companies. 
For this reason, you will not feel like you know everything at the end of the course - instead you will end up realising how much more there is to learn. This is normal, in fact, this is how everyone in the field feels. 
If you are okay with that, and accepted to **constantly learn something new for the rest of your life**, do take this course. There is the reason Data Science pays so well. 

Yes, you can use this knowledge later on if you want to go into Deep Learning. In fact, people should learn to be a proper Data Scientist before blindly jumping into Deep Learning, if they want to be successfull in the long run.
