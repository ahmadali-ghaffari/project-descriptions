# Data-Driven ðŸ¤–

## Description

Students will learn the basics of Data Science and Data Engineering by learning Python, writing code for data mining, manipulating large datasets and creating their own Machine Learning models from scratch.  
At the end of the course they will be able to create their very own, personalized Movie recommendation system, Netflox. 

More and more data is generated every day and therefor there is an even bigger need for specialists who can spot the patterns and turn that data into useful information. 
Data related jobs are among the highest paying ones, and with the advancements in Deep Learning, AI technologies are more hyped than ever.

## Technologies

We aim to give students a **solid foundation** in the basics of Data Science instead of specializing, so they can be a better asset for multiple companies in the long run.

- Python 3 and popular libraries used for data manipulation (pandas, NumPy, ScraPy, scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup4)
- Data mining via Social Media REST APIs (JSON/XML) and writing webcrawlers (for HTML content)
- Basic data cleaning and transformation methodologies, manual feature extraction methods
- Regular Expressions (and basic Natural Language Processing if there is enough time)
- SQL queries
- Simple Machine Learning models (Regression models, kNN, Decision Trees)

Students will also learn about popular, publicly available databases, running Pyhton as a backend (Flask or Django) and some basic data visualization, depending on how quickly they advance.  
Students will learn to implement certain Machine Learning techniques from scratch, instead of simply relying on calling libraries and treating the models as black boxes.

The first ~4 weeks of the course consists of learning the aforementioned technologies and doing tutorials. 
After that, there is less hand holding, and students are expected to find solutions on their own via trial and error (especially with modeling). 

The goal of the course is to allow students to:
- Have a basic understanding of what a Data Scientist does, and be able to work under a senior Data Scientists as a Data Engineer
- Learn how to be a valuable asset for companies looking for junior Data Scientists / Data Engineers who is willing to improve
- Learn how to manipulate and clean large datasets, and how to assertively communicate when they have an idea for a use-case on the company's available data
- Give them a wide view on different data related subjects and fields, so they will later be able to find further tutorials and specialize in these areas on their own
- Make them able to figure out where to get external datasets for their projects and know how to use them 
- Hear about use-cases and solutions from data-driven companies (Wallmart, Target, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, etc.) to have a better idea on how data can be used for profit
- Even if they do not chose to be a Data Scientist / Data Engineer, they should still be able to help their company with their large amounts of data or go for a Full Stack Python developer career path

At the end of the course the students will implement their very own Movie recommendation system based on the combination of the IMDB, MovieLens and multiple, manually crawled datasets. 

## Prerequisites to take the course

Please only take this course if you are already familiar with the following techniques:
- Have strong full stack developer skills (HTML, JS, CSS,  REST APIs: XML and JSON)
- Have learned about either SQL or NoSQL technologies 
- Familiar with Office Excel (or similar spreadsheet software)
- Have a **basic** understanding of statistics, probability, linear algebra (you know what vectors and matrices are) - we will not dwell into the math deeply here, but it will be required later in this field to have a deeper understanding. You can always (re)learn these concepts from KhanAcademy!
- Have at least 8GB of RAM and 10GB free disk space. Any OS is fine, because Python runs on pretty much everything. You can chose your own IDE (or Notebook) for Python

We will use Python for almost every task. However, if you already know C++ or JAVA it will be much easier for you to find a job, as some Deep Learning libraries and Big Data technologies rely on these programming languages (JAVA is a good choice for Cloudera's current solutions). 

The main difference between this class and the others is that there are will be no user stories, and most of the tasks will be required to be done by everyone, instead working together in parallel as a team, to ensure everyone learns the same things. Some of the tasks might not make sense first, but it will become clear by the end of the course why we are doing them. 

Please note that as a Data Scientist / Data Engineer, the amount of possible technologies/models/domain knowledge to learn is **infinite**. 
No one knows everything in this field, so bright people work together to come up with solutions for the companies. 
For this reason, you will not feel like you know everything at the end of the course - instead you will end up realizing how much more there is to learn. This is normal, in fact, this is how everyone in the field with experience constantly feels. 
If you are okay with that, and have accepted to **constantly learn something new for the rest of your life**, do take this course. There is the reason Data Science pays so well and there aren't that many people who are good in it. 

Yes, you can use this knowledge later on if you want to go into Deep Learning. In fact, people should learn to be a proper Data Scientist before blindly jumping into Deep Learning, if they want to be successful in the long run.
