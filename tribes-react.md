# Tribes

## Description

The purpose of this team is to create a strategy game based on the logic of [Travian](http://travian.com/). The application user will be a happy owner of a beautiful kingdom after the registration. The user has gold and food resources to feed the army, and to build a Farm, an Academy or a Mine. All the generation are time based, creating troops, buildings or upgrading them takes time based on levels. Users can attack, and occupy each others kingdom. There is a leaderboard where the users can monitor their progress.
