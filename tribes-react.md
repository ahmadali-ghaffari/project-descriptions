# Tribes

## Description

The purpose of this team is to create a strategy game based on the logic of [Travian](http://travian.com/). The application user will be a happy owner of a beautiful kingdom after the registration. The user has gold and food resources to feed the army, and to build a Farm, an Academy or a Mine. All the generation are time based, creating troops, buildings or upgrading them takes time based on levels. Users can attack, and occupy each others kingdom. There is a leaderboard where the users can monitor their progress.

## Technologies

In this project we are using React for the frontend, and Node.JS for the backend. First the apprentices learn the basics of React-Redux, and Saga middleware on the frontend. On the backend they use MongoDB which is accessed through the Mongoose library. Later they will write both unit and integration tests on the frontend and backend as well.
