The user has gold and food resources to feed the army, and to build a Farm, an Academy or a Mine. All the generation are time based, creating troops, buildings or upgrading them takes time based on levels. Users can attack, and occupy each others kingdom. There is a leaderboard where the users can monitor their progress.

They use Flyway for the database migration, and make the authentication and authorization flow based on Spring Security with JWT. After implementing the game logic,they test the whole service layer, deploy the API, and make the connection with the frontend.
